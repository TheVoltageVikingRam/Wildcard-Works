# STM32 Nucleo-F446RE Projects 🚀

This repository showcases my proficiency in working with STM32 microcontrollers using the **Nucleo-F446RE** board. It includes examples of both **Bare-Metal** and **HAL-based** programming, demonstrating a deep understanding of ARM Cortex-M4 architecture, peripheral interfacing, and embedded development workflows.
