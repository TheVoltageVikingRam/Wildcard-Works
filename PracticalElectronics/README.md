# 🧪 Practical Electronics Portfolio – IIT Madras

Welcome to my portfolio showcasing hands-on experiments in **Practical Electronics**, conducted as part of my academic journey at **IIT Madras**. This repository documents real-world implementation of key electronic principles, circuit behavior, and measurement techniques, all supported by live demonstration videos.

## 🎥 Experiment Videos

### 1. **EEC Week 2: Practical related to AC and DC excitation of Wheatstone bridge**
- 🔗 [Watch Video](https://youtu.be/u5hvhW2qX6E?si=_MFjjalNIW32h1WW)
- 🔍 Description: In this one a balanced and unbalanced Wheatstone bridge is constructed with its response to AC and DC excitation documented, and at last a low pass filter is implemented. 

### 2. **EEC Week 1: VTC characteristics of 74LS00 IC**
- 🔗 [Watch Video](https://youtu.be/Yld1Y2n6Dgg?si=LufnDxu2FQCjHH8G)
- 🔍 Description: Related to VTC characteristics of 74LS00 (NAND Gate), clearly it was my first video so not properly made with slight inconsistency in editing. That’s why I put it later 😅.

### 3. **Week3: 4_Bit_Up_Counter_and_Down_counter_with_different_clock_Source_using_74LS163**
- 🔗 [Watch Video](https://youtu.be/4WtVYkl5LJs)
- 🔍 Description: Demonstration of 4-bit up and down counting using 74LS163 IC with variation in external clock sources to understand synchronous counting and clocking behavior.
