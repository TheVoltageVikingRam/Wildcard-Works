## 🎥 Experiment Videos

### 1. **EEC Week 2: Practical eelated to AC and DC excitation of Wheatstone bride**
- 🔗 [Watch Video](https://youtu.be/u5hvhW2qX6E?si=_MFjjalNIW32h1WW)
- 🔍 Description: In this one a balanced and unbalanced whetstone bridge is constructed with its response to AC and DC excitation documented and at last a low pass filter is implemented. 

### 2. **EEC Week 1: VTC characteristics of 74LS00 IC**
- 🔗 [Watch Video](https://youtu.be/Yld1Y2n6Dgg?si=LufnDxu2FQCjHH8G)
- 🔍 Description: Related to VTC characteristicsof 74LS00 (NAND Gate), clesrly it was my first video so not properly made with error slight inconsistency in editing. Thats why i put it later 😅.
